**Repository Name: Linear-Regression-PyTorch** 

**Description:**
Linear-Regression-PyTorch is a simple project that demonstrates how to implement linear regression using PyTorch. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values based on input features. In this project, we use PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, to create a linear regression model and train it on a synthetic dataset.

**Project Structure:**
- `linear_regression.py`: Python script containing the implementation of the linear regression model using PyTorch.
- `README.md`: Markdown file containing project information, usage instructions, and documentation.

**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/Linear-Regression-PyTorch.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Linear-Regression-PyTorch
   ```
3. Run the `linear_regression.py` script to train the linear regression model:
   ```
   python linear_regression.py
   ```

**Dependencies:**
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
